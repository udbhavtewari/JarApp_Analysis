# Exploratory Data and Text Analysis of the Play Store reviews for Jar App
 
When it comes to investing in India, although, many apps have made the process way easier to invest be it in gold or stocks, customers are still very reluctant to try these new "Fin-Tech" apps. 
Hence, I decided to check and analyse what did the users of Jar say about their experience of using this application. Here's what I did.
- Part I ) Imported reviews from the Play Store. 
  - I imported 10000 reviews from the [Jar's Play Store site](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jar.app&showAllReviews=true).
- Part II) Cleaning of the data
  - Checked for the null values in the dataset
  - Did some EDA 
 - Part III) Running the text analysis 
   - Segmented the reviews into 3 categories based on the ratings
   - Constructed a word cloud to visualise the reviews
